## Project Overview

Teleopit is a lightweight, extensible, self-contained humanoid robot whole-body teleoperation framework. It integrates GMR (General Motion Retargeting) and supports train_mimic-exported ONNX RL policy inference.

Language: Python 3.10+
Package: `teleopit` (installed via `pip install -e .`)
Config: Hydra/OmegaConf YAML files in `teleopit/configs/`

## Architecture

```
InputProvider (BVH file / Pico4 VR) → Retargeter (GMR) → ObservationBuilder (167D) → Controller (dual-input TemporalCNN ONNX) → Robot (MuJoCo + PD / Unitree SDK)

Host policy service → onboard policy client/scheduler → 36D reference → same ObservationBuilder/Controller → Unitree SDK
```

Offline core modules communicate through `InProcessBus` (zero-copy). Sim2real
workers use localhost ZMQ plus shared-memory video rings, while the external
host-policy boundary uses strict msgpack/ZeroMQ without pickle. Core interfaces
are defined as `typing.Protocol` in `teleopit/interfaces.py`.

## Supported Surface

- Training task: `General-Tracking-G1`
- Inference observation: `velcmd_history` (167D, dual-input ONNX with `obs` + `obs_history`)
- TemporalCNN actor/critic with scaled dims (2048,1024,512,256,128)
- Realtime inference uses a retargeted-reference timeline before observation build; `reference_steps=[0]` is the default production path
- Host high-level-policy deployment uses an independent script/environment boundary; its network structure is defined by the current client/server code and protocol tests, and LeRobot is not a Teleopit dependency

## Key Technical Details

### Sim2Sim Pipeline
- Policy runs at 50Hz, PD control at 200Hz (`decimation=4`, `sim_dt=0.005`)
- Action flow: `compute_action()` returns raw action → `get_target_dof_pos()` applies clip `[-10, 10]`, scale, and `default_dof_pos`
- `assets/robots/unitree_g1/g1_29dof.xml` is the default G1 XML, not a model allowlist; training can select another task-compatible model with `--robot_xml`, and each workflow should keep its robot joint/body definitions consistent

### Multi-Viewer Support
`SimulationLoop` supports multiple simultaneous viewer windows controlled by the `viewers` config:

```bash
python scripts/run/run_sim.py controller.policy_path=policy.onnx viewers=sim2sim
python scripts/run/run_sim.py controller.policy_path=policy.onnx 'viewers=[mocap,retarget,sim2sim]'
python scripts/run/run_sim.py controller.policy_path=policy.onnx viewers=all
python scripts/run/run_sim.py controller.policy_path=policy.onnx 'viewers=[retarget,sim2sim]'
python scripts/run/run_sim.py controller.policy_path=policy.onnx 'viewers=[sim2sim,camera]'
python scripts/run/run_sim.py controller.policy_path=policy.onnx viewers=none
```

- `sim2sim`: MuJoCo physics result
- `retarget`: kinematic retarget result
- `mocap`: retargeting input skeleton rendered by MuJoCo custom geoms
- `camera`: G1 `d435i_rgb` fixed RGB camera view
- `bvh` viewer naming is removed; use `mocap`
- `viewers=all` opens `mocap`, `retarget`, and `sim2sim`; add `camera` explicitly when needed
- All viewers run in separate subprocesses because GLFW/GLX only supports one window per process
- Simulation exits when all active viewer windows are closed
- sim2real defaults to `viewers=none`; it supports only optional `viewers=retarget`
- `viewers` is the only supported viewer key; legacy `viewer` alias is removed

### default_dof_pos Propagation
RL policy outputs action offsets relative to the default standing pose:

```
target_dof_pos = clip(action, -10, 10) × action_scale + default_dof_pos
```

`default_dof_pos` comes from `robot/g1.yaml` `default_angles`. `TeleopPipeline` automatically propagates `robot_cfg.default_angles` into `controller_cfg.default_dof_pos`. If this propagation is missing, knees and elbows lose their standing offset and the robot cannot balance.

### Offline Playback
- Offline sim2sim and default sim2real both read `input.bvh_file` directly; no UDP relay path remains
- Offline sim2sim playback can be keyboard-controlled: `Space/P` pause/resume, `R` replay from frame 0, `Q` stop
- Offline pause holds the commanded pose; resume resets policy/reference state and reanchors yaw/XY without qpos interpolation or retargeter IK reset
- sim2sim keyboard playback is optional via `playback.keyboard.enabled=true`
- sim2real reuses the Unitree remote: `Start` → `STANDING`, `Y` → playback, `X` → back to `STANDING`, `L1+R1` → `DAMPING`
- `playback.pause_on_end=true` keeps the final pose and waits for manual replay

### Pico4 Realtime Input
- `Pico4InputProvider` reads realtime body tracking from the in-process `pico_bridge.PicoBridge`
- The pico-bridge receiver runs on the Teleopit host, which can be a workstation PC or robot onboard computer; do not maintain a separate onboard Pico input mode
- pico-bridge 0.2.1 is the supported runtime; camera preview uses `PicoBridge(video="frames").push_video_frame(rgb_uint8)`
- Pico video preview is optional and disabled by default; sim2sim uses the MuJoCo `d435i_rgb` camera and sim2real uses RealSense when `input.video.enabled=true`
- RealSense frame timeouts and disconnects are non-critical in sim2real: the video producer rebuilds the capture pipeline in the background, and video start/tick/stop failures must never exit `pico_input` or stop G1 control
- The supervisor treats `pico_input` as non-critical; if that process exits, `robot_control` remains active, stale mocap references hold the last command, and the Unitree remote remains available for `STANDING` or manual `DAMPING`
- Bone naming follows `pico_bridge_to_g1.json`
- The provider applies an input-space transform to match the current retarget config
- Do not hardcode that transform as a public coordinate-system contract; validate against actual retarget/sim2sim behavior when SDK or firmware changes
- Pico4 realtime control uses the same retargeted-reference timeline path as the shared realtime input stack
- Pico sim2sim supports a keyboard-driven top-level mode state machine: `STANDING → MOCAP ↔ ARMS`, `X` returns to `STANDING`
- Default Pico sim2sim keyboard mappings are `Y` → `MOCAP`, `A` → pause/resume mocap, `B` → toggle `MOCAP`/`ARMS`, `X` → back to `STANDING`, `Q` → quit
- Pico4 sim2real pause/resume is handled as a mocap-session control event (`toggle_pause`), not as a mode switch to `STANDING`
- Default Pico/controller pause button is `A`; Unitree remote `B` also pauses/resumes Pico sim2real. Resume resets policy/reference state and yaw/XY root-offset alignment while the process-isolated realtime reference worker continues its live input timeline
- Pico4 sim2real arms the process-isolated reference worker only when entering `MOCAP`; `STANDING` and `DAMPING` disarm it so cold startup frames do not warm-start GMR before mocap entry
- Pico4 sim2sim/sim2real support `ARMS` mode toggled from `MOCAP` with Pico/controller `B`; retargeting continues, while the control loop sends the motion tracker a composed reference with stand-pose body/legs/waist and live retargeted arms
- `ARMS` entering/exiting/resume resets policy/reference alignment and uses Kp ramp; offline BVH sim2real does not use `ARMS`, and Unitree remote `B` remains BVH replay
- Realtime Pico pause/resume and `MOCAP ↔ ARMS` switches use a retargeter-preserving soft reset: policy/reference state, smoothers, and reference alignment are reset, while the GMR IK warm-start is retained
- Optional LinkerHand control uses `hands.enabled=true`, `hands.driver=linkerhand_l6|linkerhand_o6`, and `hands.mode=gripper|vr_hand_pose`; default is disabled
- Optional Pico sim2real HDF5 recording uses `--config-name sim2real_record` or `recording.enabled=true`; it requires `input.provider=pico4`, `input.video.enabled=true`, `input.video.source=realsense`, an interactive terminal, and the `recording` extra
- Recording is manual only: terminal `R` starts an episode, `S` saves, `D` discards the active episode, and `Q` shuts down; `STANDING`, `MOCAP`, `ARMS`, and paused mocap are recordable
- Recording requires a fresh RealSense frame before `R` can start an episode; an active episode is discarded after one second without a fresh camera frame while Pico input and G1 control continue, and recording does not restart automatically when video recovers
- Recording captures `observation.images.d435i_rgb` RealSense RGB video at 30Hz plus `observation.state(68)`, scalar `observation.mode`, and `action(36)` as the root-plus-joint reference consumed by the motion tracker; when LinkerHand control is enabled, `observation.state.hand(12)` stores the left/right hardware joint readback and `action.hand(12)` stores the target; when OpenNeck control is enabled, `observation.state.neck(2)` stores the servo `[yaw_deg, pitch_deg]` readback and `action.neck(2)` stores the mechanically clamped target
- Sim2real recording uses an editable source layout: `schema.json`, `episodes.jsonl`, per-episode HDF5 files under `recording.output_dir/data/`, and compressed MP4 files under `recording.output_dir/videos/d435i_rgb/`; task prompts live only in `episodes.jsonl`, and HDF5 files contain only frame arrays with no metadata attributes or raw RGB datasets
- Recording `schema.json` stores `robot_type=unitree_g1_29dof`, `hand_type=none|linkerhand_l6|linkerhand_o6`, `neck_type=none|openneck`, FPS, and feature definitions; optional hand/neck state and action fields are controlled directly by `hands.enabled` and `neck.enabled`; the recording worker rejects an existing mismatched schema without writing episodes, but remains non-critical and must not stop the G1 control runtime; the previous attribute-based HDF5 layout is unsupported
- Episodes interrupted before their `episodes.jsonl` entry is committed are discarded on the next recording-worker startup and do not consume an episode index
- Review saved sim2real recordings with `scripts/view/view_recording.py`; it validates manifest/HDF5/MP4 alignment and synchronizes camera video, an observed-vs-reference MuJoCo overlay, joint/mode plots, and optional hand/neck signals; because measured root XYZ is not recorded, the observed robot is anchored to the reference root position
- `gripper` mode reuses `Pico4InputProvider.get_controller_snapshot()` and supports LinkerHand L6 and O6; the side grip trigger is a deadman enable, the index trigger controls closure while it is held, and releasing the side grip opens that hand
- `vr_hand_pose` mode reuses `Pico4InputProvider.get_hand_snapshot()` and somehand 0.3.0 public `somehand.api` for continuous Pico hand-pose retargeting; do not start a second `PicoBridge` for hand control
- Teleopit owns Pico 26-joint hand-state to 21-landmark conversion; do not import `somehand.pico_input`
- LinkerHand O6 supports `hands.mode=gripper|vr_hand_pose`; its default `close_pose` is `[86, 73, 118, 111, 110, 111]`
- L6 `gripper` mode uses the configured `hands.linkerhand_l6.speed` (default `[50]*6`); O6 `gripper` mode uses `hands.linkerhand_o6.speed` (default `[255]*6`); `vr_hand_pose` always sets LinkerHand L6/O6 speed to `[255]*6`
- `vr_hand_pose` defaults to a low-latency somehand path: `hands.somehand.rate_hz=60`, `max_iterations=12`, `temporal_filter_alpha=1.0`, and `output_alpha=1.0`; this prioritizes response speed over smoothing
- LinkerHand control is active in all sim2real modes when `hands.enabled=true`; shutdown and hand-runtime failure must send the configured open pose
- In `vr_hand_pose` mode, missing/inactive hand pose holds the last commanded pose for that side instead of opening the hand
- Optional OpenNeck active-vision gimbal control uses `neck.enabled=true` and `neck.driver=openneck`; it requires `input.provider=pico4`, reuses the existing Pico receiver, and must not start a second `PicoBridge`
- OpenNeck is integrated as a non-critical sim2real `neck_worker`; failures should not stop the G1 control loop, and no OpenNeck state is added to the 167D policy observation

### Host High-Level Policy
- `scripts/run/run_high_level_policy_sim2real.py` is independent from the Pico `run_sim2real.py` runtime; it must not start PicoBridge, GMR, or the realtime retarget reference worker
- The host LeRobot/ReplayPolicy service runs in the separate `lerobot-teleopit` repository and environment; Teleopit must not depend on LeRobot, Transformers, or host policy classes
- The current client/server code and protocol tests define the ZeroMQ request/response structure. During active development, Teleopit and `lerobot-teleopit` must update that structure together; no legacy network envelope is supported
- The only shared data file is `hand_calibration.json`, which contains the LinkerHand O6 open/close calibration and must stay identical in both repositories
- The host boundary uses ZeroMQ REQ/REP with msgpack and non-pickle float32 arrays. Deployment is asynchronous and receding-horizon: the isolated client worker keeps at most one request in flight, submits the latest eligible observation every `high_level_policy.replan_steps` 30 Hz source frames, and leaves the current plan executing while inference runs. The onboard scheduler uses the echoed monotonic observation timestamp to skip elapsed source frames and replace the active plan when a newer response arrives; process isolation keeps the 50 Hz robot loop running
- Policy `get_action` input is RGB JPEG plus G1 joint positions `float32[29]`, raw measured left/right LinkerHand O6 readback `float32[12]`, measured OpenNeck yaw/pitch degrees `float32[2]`, and the observation-time active reference root pose `float32[7]` (`xyz + quaternion wxyz`) in the session-local frame. The first three arrays form the 43D model state; the source reference pose is used only to reconstruct source-relative root output and is not a model input
- The scheduler keeps a short history of the rate-limited active session-local reference and queries/interpolates it at each camera timestamp. Session reset seeds this history from the initial active reference; the source anchor must never be reconstructed from the robot's measured root pose
- Canonical action is `float32[T,50]` with protocol horizon `T` in `[1,50]`: local root `xyz(3)` + local root quaternion `wxyz(4)` + G1 joint reference `29` + left/right O6 closure `12` + OpenNeck yaw/pitch degrees `2`
- The body reference `[0:36]` is yaw/XY-delocalized once and sent through the existing motion tracker. It is never sent directly as a G1 motor command and must not pass through the mocap alignment a second time
- High-level-policy formal robot modes are `IDLE`, `STANDING`, `POLICY`, and `DAMPING`. After Unitree remote `Y`, Teleopit creates exactly one host session and remains in `STANDING` only while waiting for its first valid chunk; that chunk enters `POLICY` directly. There is no candidate-reference alignment, entry Kp ramp, second session/reset, or `POLICY_STARTING` mode. The 50 Hz output limiter starts from the measured robot reference captured when the session begins, and an entry failure remains in `STANDING`
- Unitree remote controls are `Start -> STANDING`, `Y -> request POLICY`, `B -> pause/resume`, `X -> STANDING/cancel pending`, and `L1+R1 -> DAMPING`
- Policy pause freezes the scheduler/body reference and holds the latest hand/neck command. Leaving `POLICY` opens LinkerHand and centers OpenNeck
- The onboard scheduler clips G1 joint references to `real_robot.joint_pos_lower/upper` when the required correction is at most `high_level_policy.safety.max_joint_projection_rad` (default `0.1` rad), and clips OpenNeck yaw/pitch commands to their configured degree ranges. It rejects whole chunks on excessive joint correction, shape/finiteness, session/sequence, quaternion, absolute root height, hand closure, or staleness failures. It accepts temporal root, yaw, and joint-reference discontinuities at entry, inside chunks, and across chunks because recorded pause/resume transitions may be discontinuous; accepted root translation, yaw, and joint output is rate-limited at 50 Hz. Never pad or trim malformed host output, and do not clip other out-of-range fields into validity
- A newer timestamp-aligned chunk normally replaces the active plan before its horizon ends. If inference runs longer, the scheduler holds the plan's final reference for `high_level_policy.hold_s`; exhausting that grace period triggers the action watchdog. A request timeout, host/network failure, watchdog expiry, or loss of a required camera/client worker puts `POLICY` into the same resumable pause state used by remote `B`; an invalid result is rejected while the last valid plan remains available. The runtime never enters `STANDING` automatically; `B` resumes after a fresh valid chunk is available, while `X` remains the manual transition to `STANDING`
- Initial production hardware support requires two LinkerHand O6 hands and OpenNeck because all 50 canonical action dimensions are active
- OpenNeck 0.2.0 is the supported runtime; Teleopit sends physical degrees through `move_deg()`, and the direct-drive OpenNeck package converts degrees to servo steps and clips them to its calibrated mechanical limits; the removed normalized API and config fields are unsupported
- OpenNeck maps the independent HMD `PicoFrame.head.rotation` relative to the same-frame full-body `Body.Spine3` orientation; it must never use the full-body `Body.Head` skeleton joint for neck control, and HMD pose updates must remain independent of duplicate-body-frame filtering
- OpenNeck uses a fixed identity neutral pose and no neck-side EMA; it must not capture the first live frame as a runtime zero pose, so tracking can start while the operator's head is turned
- After the raw relative-angle dead zone, `neck.pitch_gain` (default `1.4`) scales pitch before `move_deg()` while yaw remains one-to-one; OpenNeck remains responsible for final mechanical clipping; positive yaw turns left and positive pitch looks up

### SimulationLoop Runtime Behavior
- `realtime=true` enforces wall-clock pacing even without a viewer
- `num_steps=0` means infinite loop (`max_steps = 2**63`)
- `KeyboardInterrupt` is handled for clean shutdown
- BVH frame alignment is time-based: `bvh_idx = int(policy_time × input_fps)`
- Realtime reference buffering is controlled by `retarget_buffer_enabled`, `retarget_buffer_window_s`, `retarget_buffer_delay_s`, `reference_steps`, and `realtime_buffer_warmup_steps`
- Realtime inferred `motion_joint_vel`, anchor linear velocity, and anchor angular velocity can be EMA-smoothed via `reference_velocity_smoothing_alpha` and `reference_anchor_velocity_smoothing_alpha`
- Sim2real Pico pause/resume uses mocap-session states `ACTIVE ↔ PAUSED`; resume clears policy/reference state, rebuilds yaw/XY root alignment, and does not interpolate retarget qpos from the paused pose
- Realtime sim2sim with Pico control events uses the same mocap-session pause/resume semantics and rebuilds the realtime reference path on resume, including the configured warmup
- Realtime Pico sim2sim `STANDING -> MOCAP` resets GMR, seeds its floating root from the current live pelvis target, and rebuilds the realtime reference path before accepting references; Pico sim2real performs the same GMR cold start through its rearmed process-isolated reference worker
- Realtime Pico sim2sim can start directly in `STANDING` with keyboard mode control enabled via top-level `keyboard.enabled`

### Inference Observation
Observation format: `velcmd_history` (167D, dual-input ONNX)

```
ref_joint_pos(29)
+ ref_joint_vel(29)
+ ref_anchor_ori_b(6)
+ robot_base_ang_vel_b(3)
+ robot_joint_pos_rel(29)
+ robot_joint_vel(29)
+ prev_action(29)
+ robot_projected_gravity_b(3)
+ ref_anchor_lin_vel_b(3)
+ ref_anchor_ang_vel_b(3)
+ ref_projected_gravity_b(3)
+ ref_anchor_height(1)
```

Runtime constraints:
- Public builder is `VelCmdObservationBuilder`
- `RLPolicyController` accepts dual-input `obs` + `obs_history` ONNX
- Startup validates the observation definition against the ONNX signature and raises immediately on mismatch

### Training Task
The single supported training task is `General-Tracking-G1` (experiment name: `g1_general_tracking`).

- Uses TemporalCNN actor/critic with scaled dims (2048,1024,512,256,128)
- 167D `velcmd_history` observation, dual-input ONNX export
- Training env uses `sampling_mode="rewind"`
- Tracking rewards include root position/orientation/linear velocity/angular velocity, body pose/velocity, joint position/velocity, survival, action-rate, joint-limit, self-collision, and ankle acceleration terms
- Supported motion sampling modes are `uniform`, `start`, and `rewind`; `rewind` restarts failed environments from the same clip after stepping back `rewind_min_steps..rewind_max_steps` with probability `rewind_prob`, otherwise it falls back to uniform sampling
- Playback and benchmark use `play=True`, which switches motion sampling to `start`; benchmark pins exact clip ids/start times, disables clip-end resampling, and reports `MPJPE(m)`, `root_pos_error(m)`, `root_rot_error(rad)`, `root_vel_error(m/s)`, and `success_rate(%)`
- `window_steps=[0]`
- `save_onnx.py` exports dual-input TemporalCNN ONNX

### Dataset Pipeline
- Dataset build spec supports a `preprocess` section for root-xy normalization, ground alignment, and basic clip filtering
- Final distributed dataset build outputs are minimal HDF5 shards directly under `data/datasets/<dataset>/` (recursive shard discovery is supported; no train/val split and no manifest file)
- `train_mimic/scripts/data/precompute_dataset.py` converts a minimal dataset into a separate precomputed training dataset directory; `build_dataset.py` must not run precompute
- Each shard stores only `root_pos`, `root_quat_w`, `joint_pos`, `body_names`, and clip-aware window metadata (`clip_starts`, `clip_lengths`, `clip_fps`); long clips are split into overlapping bounded windows
- Training `motion_file` must point to a precomputed training dataset, not the minimal distributed dataset; training reads joint velocities and body FK/velocities from those precomputed shards and must not run MuJoCo FK while loading motion clips
- `MotionLib` loads all discovered precomputed HDF5 motion windows into CPU/GPU memory at startup
- `MotionLib` samples only valid center frames for the configured `window_steps`; default is `window_steps=[0]`
- Training supports `uniform` and `rewind` sampling over the fully loaded precomputed dataset
- `scripts/run/record_pico_motion.py` records Pico live body tracking as retargeted G1 motion NPZ clips in `data/pico_motion/clips/`; it opens a live `Retarget` viewer, uses terminal keys `R/S/D/N/Q`, stores semantic labels in filenames, and intentionally does not write per-clip JSON
- Build Pico-recorded clips into shards with `python train_mimic/scripts/data/build_dataset.py --spec data/pico_motion/pico_recorded.yaml --force`

Quick reference:

```bash
python train_mimic/scripts/data/build_dataset.py --spec train_mimic/configs/datasets/twist2.yaml

python train_mimic/scripts/save_onnx.py --checkpoint logs/rsl_rl/g1_general_tracking/<run>/model_30000.pt --output policy.onnx --history_length 10
```

### GMR Retargeting
- Self-contained in `teleopit/retargeting/gmr/`; assets need `scripts/setup/download_assets.py --only robots gmr`
- Supports `lafan1` BVH (22 joints, 30fps, centimeters)
- Supports `hc_mocap` BVH (50 joints, 60fps downsampled to 30fps, meters)
- `lafan1-resolved` still needs an adapter layer and remains unsupported

### External Assets
- Do not commit robot meshes, datasets, checkpoints, or demo media to Git; use `scripts/setup/download_assets.py`
- G1 XML variants and their meshes are downloaded under `assets/robots/unitree_g1/` by the `robots` asset group and are not tracked in Git; `g1_29dof.xml` is the default
- The neck-and-O6 runtime variant is `assets/robots/unitree_g1/g1_29dof_neck_o6.xml`
- Released tracking assets download under `ckpt/` as the matching `track_g1.{pt,onnx}` and `track_g1_neck_o6.{pt,onnx}` pairs
- `teleopit/retargeting/gmr/assets/` is gitignored; downloaded at runtime
- `train_mimic/assets/` is no longer tracked; FK tooling uses the robot assets under `assets/robots/`, with `assets/robots/unitree_g1/g1_29dof.xml` as the default G1 model
- `third_party/linkerhand-python-sdk` and `third_party/somehand` support optional LinkerHand sim2real control
- Run `python scripts/dev/check_large_tracked_files.py` before pushing

Assets are split across two ModelScope repos by type:

| Repo | Type | Contents |

Asset group → repo mapping is defined in `teleopit/runtime/external_assets.py` (`MODEL_REPO_ID` / `DATASET_REPO_ID`).

**Uploading a new release:**

```bash
# 1. Prepare upload directory
python scripts/setup/prepare_modelscope_assets.py --only ckpt robots gmr bvh --clean
python scripts/setup/prepare_modelscope_assets.py --only data

# 2. Upload to each repo
modelscope upload --repo-type model BingqianWu/Teleopit-models \
  data/modelscope_upload/checkpoints checkpoints --sync
modelscope upload --repo-type model BingqianWu/Teleopit-models \
  data/modelscope_upload/archives archives
modelscope upload --repo-type dataset BingqianWu/Teleopit-datasets \
  data/modelscope_upload/data data

# 3. Tag the release on the model repo (match the Git tag; dataset repo does not support tags)
python -c "from modelscope.hub.api import HubApi; api=HubApi(); print(api.create_model_tag('BingqianWu/Teleopit-models', 'vX.Y.Z'))"
```

The old `BingqianWu/Teleopit-assets` repo is deprecated; do not upload to it.

### IK Offset Calibration
For each `(robot_body, human_bone)` pair, IK config stores a quaternion offset `R_offset` (`w,x,y,z`, scalar-first):

```
R_result = R_human * R_offset
R_offset = R_human_tpose^{-1} * R_robot_tpose
```

Critical note: align robot root orientation to the BVH human forward direction before computing `R_robot_tpose`. For `hc_mocap`, G1 default faces `+X` while the BVH human faces `-Y` (`Z-up`), so the robot root must receive a `-90°` Z rotation first.

`scripts/dev/compute_ik_offsets.py` can print or write calibrated offsets.

## Development

### Simplicity Policy
- Prefer the smallest implementation that satisfies the current requirement
- Do not add speculative configuration switches, abstraction layers, compatibility paths, or extensibility without a concrete use case
- Reuse existing enable flags and data flows when they already express the required behavior

### Runtime Validation Policy
- Fail fast for logical mismatches such as observation definition vs. ONNX signature mismatch
- Do not silently pad, trim, clip, or replace invalid data/config to "make it run"
- Error messages should identify the mismatched components and the direct fix path

### Commit Policy
- Do not auto-commit changes
- Use the default git user as commit author
- After major feature changes, update `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` together with the code
- English docs (`docs/docs/`), Chinese docs (`docs/i18n/zh-Hans/`), and code implementation must stay in sync. Chinese docs are translations of the English originals — never generate Chinese content independently; always translate from the corresponding English page
- Documentation updates must be written for users and developers as stable product/development guidance, not as explanations of the current code patch or implementation diff

```bash
pip install -e .
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Known Issues

1. `lafan1-resolved` retargeting is still broken because it uses a different BVH skeleton layout.
2. Legacy downloaded GMR XMLs under `teleopit/retargeting/gmr/assets/unitree_g1/` are separate retargeting assets, not replacements for the runtime robot bundle under `assets/robots/unitree_g1/`; `g1_29dof.xml` is the default runtime G1 model.
